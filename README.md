# Buzzer & Cookies Game Project

## Project Description
The Buzzer & Cookies Game is a simple browser game where players have to hit a buzzer with a cookie to earn points. The game consists of multiple levels, and as the player progresses, the difficulty increases. Players have three chances to hit the buzzer with a cookie, and each successful hit earns them points and advances them to the next level. The game ends when the player runs out of chances.
